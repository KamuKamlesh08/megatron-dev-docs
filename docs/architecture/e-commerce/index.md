# E-Commerce System ADR Overview

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a documented process used in e-commerce systems to record important decisions related to system design. The main purpose is to ensure that the team knows which architectural choices were made, the reasons behind them, and what alternatives were considered.

## Key Points

- **Decision Documentation:** Every major architectural decision is written as an ADR, such as technology stack selection, database choice, deployment strategy, etc.
- **Transparency:** All team members can easily understand the decisions and their reasons.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** New team members get context about the systemâ€™s architecture and its evolution.
- **Change Tracking:** If a decision changes in the future, the record is maintained.

## E-Commerce Context

In an e-commerce system, ADRs are used to document typical decisions such as microservices vs monolith, payment gateway integration, inventory management approach, scalability solutions, and security practices.

In this way, ADRs help make the e-commerce system architecture robust, maintainable, and scalable.
