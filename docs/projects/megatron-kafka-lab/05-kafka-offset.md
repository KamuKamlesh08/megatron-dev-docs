# Kafka Offsets

---

## 1. What is an Offset?

- An **Offset** is the position of a message inside a partition.
- Each message in a partition is assigned a unique, incremental number called the **Offset**.

**Train Analogy:**

- Imagine a **train compartment** (partition).
- Every seat in that compartment has a **seat number**.
- A passenger (message) sitting on a seat represents a message stored at that **offset**.

---

## 2. Why are Offsets Needed?

Offsets indicate **where a consumer is in the log**.

- Without offsets, a consumer would not know which messages it has already read.
- This could cause:
  - **Duplication** (re-reading the same messages)
  - **Loss** (skipping some messages)

**Train Analogy:**

- A ticket checker (consumer) verifies passengers seat by seat.
- If he does not track seat numbers (offsets):
  - He may **check the same passenger twice**.
  - Or **miss some passengers entirely**.

---

## 3. Benefits of Offsets

### a) Progress Tracking

- Consumers know exactly up to which message they have consumed.
- **Analogy:** Ticket checker notes: “Checked till Seat #42 in Compartment-1.”

### b) Fault Tolerance

- If a consumer crashes, it can resume from the last committed offset.
- **Analogy:** Ticket checker goes for a break, then returns and starts from Seat #43.

### c) Parallelism

- Each consumer group maintains its own offsets independently.
- **Analogy:** Multiple ticket checkers can work on the same train, each tracking their own compartments.

## 4. What if Offsets Did Not Exist?

- Consumers would have to start from the beginning every time.
- This could lead to duplicate processing or skipped messages.

**Train Analogy:**

- Without seat numbers, a ticket checker might re-check the **entire train** or miss passengers altogether.

---

## 5. Who Manages Offsets?

- Kafka stores offsets in an **internal topic called `__consumer_offsets`**.
- When a consumer processes a message, it **commits the offset**.
- On restart, the consumer resumes from the **last committed offset**.

**Train Analogy:**

- The ticket checker verifies Seat #42 and writes it down in a **notebook**.
- The notebook is like the `__consumer_offsets` topic.
- If the checker leaves and returns, he opens the notebook and continues from Seat #43.

## 6. Flow of Offsets (Step by Step)

1. Passenger boards → Message produced and stored in a partition.
2. Ticket checker arrives → Consumer fetches the message.
3. Ticket checker verifies passenger → Message is processed.
4. Ticket checker writes: “Seat #42 checked” → Offset is committed.
5. Ticket checker comes back later and starts from Seat #43 → Consumer resumes from the next offset.

## Quick Recap

- **Offset = Seat number in a compartment (partition)**
- **Purpose:** Track progress, enable fault tolerance, support parallelism
- **Without offsets:** Risk of duplicate reads or missing messages
- **Management:** Kafka handles offsets in the `__consumer_offsets` topic
- **Flow:** Read → Process → Commit → Resume
