# Kafka = Railway Analogy

Kafka concepts can be simplified using a **train system analogy**.  
Each section below has a **definition** and a **railway analogy** side by side.

---

## 1. Topic

**Definition:**  
A topic is a logical channel in Kafka where messages/events of the same type are stored.

**Analogy (Train):**  
A **train route** — it defines where the train goes, and only passengers of that route are allowed.

---

## 2. Partition

**Definition:**  
A topic is split into partitions. Each partition maintains its own ordered sequence of messages.

**Analogy (Compartments):**  
A train has **compartments**. Each compartment has its own seat numbers, just like each partition has its own offsets.

---

## 3. Offset

**Definition:**  
An offset is a unique sequential ID assigned to every message inside a partition.

**Analogy (Seat Number):**  
Each passenger in a compartment has a **seat number**. Similarly, each message in a partition has an offset.

---

## 4. Producer

**Definition:**  
A producer is an application or service that sends messages to Kafka topics.

**Analogy (Passenger Boarding):**  
A **passenger boards the train** and sits in a compartment — the producer sends a message, and Kafka places it in a partition.

---

## 5. Consumer

**Definition:**  
A consumer is an application or service that reads messages from Kafka topics.

**Analogy (Ticket Checker):**  
A **ticket checker** goes through compartments and validates passengers. Similarly, consumers read messages from partitions.

---

## 6. Consumer Group

**Definition:**  
A consumer group is a set of consumers working together to consume data from a topic. Each partition is assigned to only one consumer within a group.

**Analogy (Team of Ticket Checkers):**  
Multiple **ticket checkers** are assigned compartments so no compartment is checked twice.

---

## 7. Offset Commit

**Definition:**  
Consumers store their read progress (last offset processed) in Kafka’s internal `__consumer_offsets` topic.

**Analogy (Checking Progress):**  
Ticket checkers mark the **last seat they checked**. If they leave and come back, they continue from where they left off.

# Example Flow (Bank Onboarding – Kamu Kamlesh)

**Scenario:** Kamu Kamlesh applies for a new bank account. Let’s map the journey:

1. **Topic Creation (Train Ready)**

   - Admin creates a topic `onboarding-requested`.
   - Think of it as a **train route with 3 compartments (partitions)**.

2. **Producer Publishes Event (Passenger Boards)**

   - Kamu submits his request.
   - Producer app sends it → Kafka places it in **Partition-1, Seat #0 (Offset 0)**.

3. **More Events (More Seats Occupied)**

   - `"Documents uploaded"` → Seat #1.
   - `"KYC Passed"` → Seat #2.
   - `"Account Created"` → Seat #3.

4. **Bank Services as Consumers (Ticket Checkers)**

   - **Identity Service** checks KYC/AML (validates passengers).
   - **Account Service** creates the bank account (processes passengers).
   - **Notification Service** sends SMS/email (informs passengers).

5. **Offset Commit (Progress Tracking)**
   - Each service commits offsets:  
     e.g., “Checked till Seat #3”.
   - On restart, they continue from the last committed seat.

# Quick Recap

- **Topic = Train route** (channel for related events)
- **Partition = Compartment** (parallelism)
- **Offset = Seat number** (unique message ID)
- **Producer = Passenger boarding** (event creation)
- **Consumer = Ticket checker** (service reading events)
- **Consumer Group = Team of ticket checkers** (divide work)
- **Offset Commit = Last checked seat** (progress tracking)

Kamu Kamlesh’s onboarding (request → documents → KYC → account creation) is like **filling seats in a train**, and bank services (ticket checkers) ensure each seat/event is processed and tracked.
